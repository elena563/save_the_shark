  description: The White Shark is considered the most dangerous shark to humans, although it actually much prefers a wide range of 
                other prey such as turtles, seals or dolphins. It is in fact a very skilled hunter and swimmer, equipped with large, 
                serrated teeth, which puts it at the top of the marine food chain surpassing even other sharks.

  description: The shortfin mako or mako shark is the fastest and most areodynamic shark in the world, in fact it can swim up to a 
                speed of 75 km/h due to its symmetrical tail and warm-blooded circulation. Due to its agility and characteristic teeth,
                it is also used to hunt fast fish such as tuna, marlin and swordfish.

  description: The whale shark is the fish as well as the largest shark in the world. It is called a whale precisely because of its 
                            affinity with the large mammal; it is in fact a filter-feeder, feeding on plankton and small fish that it sucks up 
                            through its many rows of tiny teeth. It is therefore harmless to humans. It swims very slowly and is a solitary animal.

  description: The basking shark is the second largest fish and, like the whale shark, filters plankton and small fish from the water
                            thanks to its large mouth. They are rather slow and not very agile animals that do not fear human presence, however, 
                            they are capable of jumping out of the water, for example to get rid of parasites. During warmer hours, however, 
                            they stay on the surface to simply rest in the sun.

  description: "The Leuca or Zambezi Shark is considered the most dangerous shark ever to humans because of its unpredictable,

                venture unhindered into the fresh waters of rivers and lakes for thousands of kilometers."
